## 1. Introduction:

This is an analysis of shark attacks that happened around the world. The main objective was to try to find how many women were killed versus men around the world. 

We were provided with a data set available on Kaggle, the information the data set contained was messy, so we were asked to clean it and answer a specific business question.

Besides the information available on the data set we also used google to do some factchecking of those attacks.

## 2. Hypothesis: ho How many females were killed by sharks versus males.

When we were given this task, the first thing I thought was that, probably we are going to have more males than females getting killed by sharks. What lead me to think about this was that I always associated sea activities to males, more than females (fishing, surfing, sailing). So I thought, letâ€™s try to find how many females were killed by sharks.

I ended up looking at the age groups of the murdered victims and the deadliest years.
